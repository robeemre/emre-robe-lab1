<h1>Streets and Expressways</h1>
<p>Toronto provides motorists various ways into, out of, and through the city. Highway 401, the busiest expressway in North America, is the main east-west thoroughfare through Toronto. The Gardiner Expressway connects downtown to western suburbs, while the Don Valley Parkway connects downtown with northern and eastern suburbs. Various arterial roads — such as Yonge, Bloor, and Bathurst Streets — provide surface-level, multi-modal routes within and beyond the city core.
    <br>
    <br>Despite these high-capacity links, Toronto suffers from some of the worst traffic congestion in the world. Part of this stems from the fact that Toronto's current expressways are a skeleton network of what was originally envisioned. A ring of expressways encircling downtown would have connected to a new east-west freeway north of Bloor Street, as well as planned extensions of Highway 400 and Allen Road. However, these plans would have required the destruction of several vibrant neighborhoods — including part of the University of Toronto campus — as well as an enourmous amount of space dedicated to parking. As residents became increasingly aware of the detrimental impacts these expressways could bring, all remaining plans for their construction were abadondoned by the 1970s.
